<h2>Inertia Technologies</h2>
A website built for a fake space robotics company designed to showcase my CSS/HTML abilities, putting together a lot of what I have learned over the last ~5 months. This will be an 
ongoing project as I seek to implement more things I learn over time.

<h2>what I learned</h2>
Learned a lot about flexbox and positioning. I feel so much more confident wielding flexbox.<br>
I also learned quite a lot about CSS animations and displaying video - something I had basic knowledge of but had not played around with it.<br>
Creating the video background was an awesome experience.<br> 
I also learned a bit more about resizing images.<br>
Overall it has been very rewarding and as I seek more knowledge I want to expand on this project! <br>
Most importantly I learned a lot about responsive web design and the more code I write, the more interested I
become in designing mobile first.

<h2>how to view</h2>
Right now the responsive design is a little bit busted, though it does work and there is some rudimentary
media query making it "okay" to read on a mobile device.

Also, since it uses WebKit you will need a WebKit based browser to view it meaning this will not
display correctly on older browsers.
