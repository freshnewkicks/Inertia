# Inertia
HTML/CSS website for a fake space robotics company. Still working on it. Please feel free to note any edits you make!

<h2>Inertia Technologies</h2>
A website built for a fake space robotics company designed to showcase my CSS/HTML abilities, putting together a lot of what I have learned over the last ~5 months. This will be an 
ongoing project as I seek to implement more things I learn over time.

<h2>what I learned</h2>
Learned a lot about flexbox and positioning. I feel so much more confident wielding flexbox.
I also learned quite a lot about CSS animations and displaying video - something I had basic knowledge of but had not played around with it.
Creating the video background was an awesome experience. 
I also learned a bit more about resizing images.
Overall it has been very rewarding and as I seek more knowledge I want to expand on this project!
